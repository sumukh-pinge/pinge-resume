      # Choose a user profile to display (a folder name within `content/authors/`)
      username: admin

# Other sections can be added here in a similar fashion, by uncommenting and configuring them as needed.

# Example of an uncommented section:
# - block: collection
#   id: posts
#   content:
#     title: Recent Posts
#     count: 5
#     order: desc
#   design:
#     view: compact
#     columns: '2'

# Further blocks would follow the same pattern: define the block type, provide content, and optionally design settings.
